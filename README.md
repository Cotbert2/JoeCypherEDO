# JoeCypherEDO

JoeCypherEDO is an encryptation and decryptation algorithm as a subset of Joe Cybersecurity Framework.
It use Lorenz' Atractor **chaotical system**  as ordinary differential ecuations systen with the purpose of encrypting and decrypting messages as a **symmetric key** algorithm.

The scripts manage the behavior of the cypher algorithm and offer an API to use it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cotbert2/JoeCypherEDO.git
```

2. Init the python3 virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Scripts

1. lorenzAtractorViewer.py: 
Script to visualize the Lorenz' Atractor in 3D; you can change initial conditions and parameters to see the behavior of the system.
